Over the last few months, the GDL team has been experimenting with AI, or more specifically, integrating the GDL platform with different AI and cognitive services. We are not ourselves developing AI components as this is not our primary focus as a project, but we are integrating the GDL and the open educational resources in our platform with AI components that offer APIs.

We are using AI only when it helps us reach our project goals, and in this initial phase, we think AI can help us reach new users on emerging platforms and enhance the quality of content and metadata.

In our prototyping we have started exploring:

- [Google Assistant](https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/overview)
- [Microsoft Cognitive Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/), for spell checking and language processing at a later stage.
- [Image-processing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/vision/) algorithms(only in planning) to smartly identify, caption, index and ad alt-text to pictures. In this case, we might use MS Cognitive Services or [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/blog/making_media_accessible_how_to_automatically_generate_alt_text_for_images).
