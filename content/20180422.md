The GDL project will follow the principles of universal design and accessibility and will have a strong focus on making all content generally accessible, including for those with print disabilities, i.e. blindness or low vision, severe dyslexia, or mobility impairment.

**Web accessibility** refers to the inclusive practice of removing barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to **websites**, by people with disabilities. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, all users have equal access to information and functionality.

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 covers a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible. GDL will follow these guidelines to secure that the content is accessible for all users. By following these guidelines one will also often make the web content more usable in general.

The GDL platform is compliant to all WCAG 2.0 AA requirements and more than 15 of the AAA requirements.

Some of the titles that are part of the initial launch will not be WCAG 2.0 AA compliant, mostly because they lack alt-text for the pictures and illustrations.

## User testing for accessibility

Successful digital initiatives are rooted in an understanding of user characteristics, needs, and challenges. User-centered design — also referred to as design thinking or human-centered design — starts with getting to know the people you are designing for through conversation, observation, and co-creation. Ensuring that our services are accessible for all has been an important part of the GDL project and we have engaged with users that have vision impairment.
