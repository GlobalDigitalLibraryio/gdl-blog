The last few days, the GDL team has been working on designing new features for the GDL with children in schools in Kibera (Nairobi), the largest urban slum in Africa. It has been a true privilege!

The goal of this iteration of testing has been:

- Testing new games and interactive content
- Re-testing navigation on our web app
- Initial testing with kids that use Google assistant to access the GDL

The most important learning this week is that even a child living in a shed, without water and electricity can be an expert on a smartphone. Praise and Faith (10 years old) in this video showed us how they are using voice to read books with Google assistant.
