We are excited to announce that from today, you can access the GDL Library with Google Assistant, using only your voice to interact with the GDL. This is a totally new way for our users to access our platform, giving users the option of asking the assistant to search for books and read books aloud.

##How does it work?
If you open your Google Assistant on your phone and say “GDL Library” in any sentence, you will start a conversation with the GDL. For example, you can say: “Can I speak to the GDL Library?”

The assistant can help you search for books and read them for you. For example:

- search for a book just name the topic of the book, for example, “dog” or “list books about dogs”.
- If you want the assistant to read for you, simply use the word “read”. For example “read a book about dogs” or “please read the book Come Back, Cat!”. The assistant will read books out loud and show the illustrations for the relevant page on your screen.
- You can also ask the Google Assistant to list books on level 1 -4.
- To exit the conversation, simply say “Goodbye GDL”.

This is how it would look on your screen:
